\newcommand{\pair}[1]{\ensuremath{\left\langle#1\right\rangle}}
\newcommand{\setof}[1]{\ensuremath{\left\{#1\right\}}}

% We have \to, why not \from? â€” also we wrap both in \ensuremath, so we can use
% them in plain text. If you want \to or \from to be followed by a space while
% in text, follow them with an escaped space \ : lorem \to\ ipsum.
\newcommand{\from}{\ensuremath{\leftarrow}}
\renewcommand{\to}{\ensuremath{\rightarrow}}

% Working with vectors
\newcommand{\Vlength}[1]{\ensuremath{\left\|#1\right\|}}
